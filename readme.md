# Reverse Initiative Order
This module sorts the order of combatants in the combat tracker from lowest initiative to highest.
This is useful for systems like RuneQuest that use numbered "strike ranks".

## Installation 
1 Inside Foundry's Configuration and Setup screen, go to Add-on Modules

2 Click "Install Module"

3 In the Manifest URL field paste: https://github.com/wakeand/fvtt-module-reverseinitiativeorder/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Usage
Once activated the order in the combat tracker will go from lowest to highest instead of the other way around.
No other config necessary.
